1. How do you create an object named person with properties name and age?

let person = {name , age};

2.  Given the object let car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2020 };, how do you access the model property using both dot notation and bracket notation?

let car ={ make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2020 };
let model =car.model;
let model2 = car['model'];

console.log(model);
console.log(model2);

3. Adding Properties:

How do you add a new property color with the value 'red' to the car object?

let car ={ make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2020 };
let model =car.model;
let model2 = car['model'];
let color;

car.color='red';

console.log(model);
console.log(model2);
console.log(car);

4. Deleting Properties:

-- How do you delete the year property from the car object?

let car ={ make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: 2020 };
let model =car.model;
let model2 = car['model'];
let color;

car.color='red';

console.log(model);
console.log(model2);
delete car.year;
console.log(car);

5. Object Methods:

How do you add a method greet to the person object that logs "Hello, my name is [name]" 
to the console?

let person = {'name':'sheenam', 'age':20 ,
    greet(){
    console.log(`my name is ${person.name}`);
}};
person.greet();

6. Nested Objects:

How do you create an object user with a nested address object, and how do you access the city property of address?

let person = {'name':'sheenam', 'age':20 ,
    address:
        {
            'city':'pune',
        }
};
console.log(person.address.city);

7. Object Destructuring:

Given the object let user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };, how do you use destructuring to extract the name and age properties into variables?

let user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
let {name , age}= user; // destructuring => need to understand how this is useful in programming

console.log(name);

8. Iterating Over Properties: How do you use a for...in loop to iterate over and log all the properties of the car object?

let car = { 
    name: 'maruti', 
    make: 2005,
    model:'highend',
    
};

for(let cars in car)
{
    console.log(`${cars} ${car[cars]}`);
}
